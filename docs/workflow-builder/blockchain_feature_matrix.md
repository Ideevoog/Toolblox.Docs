## Comments

### Near Protocol

The Near blockchain is supported through three implementations: Aurora, Near and Near JS. Aurora is most feature-complete.

Near JS support is currently under active development but the aim is to achieve feature parity with Aurora. At this point the non-JS variant will be dropped. It is still possible that already-deployed workflows continue working with the JS version but caution is advised.
