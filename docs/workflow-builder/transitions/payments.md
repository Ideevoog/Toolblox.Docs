# Payments

A pillar for blockchain programming, Toolblox allows making payments from two sources: the transition caller or workflow. Multiple payments can be done.

## By the caller

Direct payments from the caller to a selected other user or to the workflow directly.

## By the workflow

Funds owned by the workflow can be released - paid out - to select users. As an example an escrow payment workflow could hold the funds and release them only after the item has been delivered successfully.
