During a transition it is possible to execute transitions in *other* workflows. A business process often times includes activities by different stakeholders, departments or business partners. Each of them have their own business items and workflows to process those items. Capability to execute cross-workflow calls enables the building of business networks.

## Example

Here you can see an example where the operations department processes loan applications while the accounting team processes cashflows. Making a cross-workflow call enables to formalize the handover process between the departments:
