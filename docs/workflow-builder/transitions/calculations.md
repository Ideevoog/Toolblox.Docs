# Calculations

Calculations are a way to set attribute values automatically. Sometimes it is more convenient and/or neccessary to set some attributes for users instead of letting them set all of the attributes themselves.

Some examples:
* Default values for attributes.
* Convenient background calculations.
* Security reasons - so that users can not override what must be a contractual clause. 

In this example Calculations are used to set the 'End time' attribute of an item to 7 days (```now + 24 * 60 * 60``` seconds)
