# Transition parameters


![Parameters in workflow](/img/screens/steps_parameters.png)

Setting up list of parameters for a transition does 2 things:
* In the user interface the client can specify the value manually
* It gets saved as an attribute to the item. As an exception [transient parameters](/docs/workflow-builder/items#transient-attributes) are something which would not be saved.
