:::caution

Toolblox DApp builder is in **ALPHA** state - many features are not yet finalized. Use it at your own volition.

:::

## Basics

In order to move from one page to another page a *link* has to be set-up. In order to establish this link the **Open Page Task** of a Widget needs to be used. All widgets allow adding this task.

:::info

If a widget can run workflow transitions then then all tasks are peformed *after* running the transition successfully. Please check the [widget list](/docs/dapp_builder/widgets#widget-list) for up-to-date info on which widget is 'blockchain enabled'.

:::

Here is a demo showing using the Open Page Task in both a blockchain-enabled and a normal widget.
