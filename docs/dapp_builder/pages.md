# Pages

## Basics

A DApp consists of pages. Each page consists of layout and widgets. To create new pages use the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/6.x/svgs/solid/circle-plus.svg"  icon="icon" width="15" height="15"/> button in the pageflow designer:


<video autoplay="autoplay" playsinline="playsinline" muted="muted" loop="loop" >
  <source src="/vid/dapp_addpage.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>


### Urls

Page name becomes the URL for the page. For example a page, named 'Details' will be resolved into the following url:
```https://app.toolblox.net/dapp/test_web_store/details```

## Layouts

A layout is a set of widget containers in a particular arrangement. Each page in the DApp can have its own layout.
