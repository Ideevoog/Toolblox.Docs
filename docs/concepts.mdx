# What is Toolblox?

Toolblox is a no-code smart contract builder, specifically designed to manage workflows around digital twins. Digital twins are digital representations of real-world business objects such as documents, offers, parcels, loans, requests, harvests etc.

## No-code smart contract builder

The [Toolblox workflow builder](/docs/workflow-builder/introduction) allows to compose workflows which are then compiled into **smart-contracts** and **deployed on a selected blockchain network**.

Each workflow consist of a definition of an [item](workflow-builder/items), list of [item states](workflow-builder/states) and [state transitions](workflow-builder/transitions/transition_basics). The workflow is represented visually in the editor as a state diagram.

:::info

A state-diagram based workflow is something which has been found across the industry to naturally fit the blockchain programming model. Here you can see a [case-study by the Hyperledger Foundation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/it/latest/developapps/scenario.html) detailing the sale of the *item* 'commercial paper' with its *states* and state *transitions* mapped out in a format suitable for a self-executing smart contract![Image](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-docs-i18n/raw/release-2.2/docs/locale/it_IT/source/developapps/develop.diagram.4.png)

The same example depicted above would look like this in the workflow builder of Toolblox:

### Auto-generated user interface

Every transition in the workflow can be executed using the *auto-generated user interface*. Here is an example where, if the item is in status 'Offer made' two options become available in the UI: Accept or Reject.

## Decentralized application builder

In contrast to the auto-generated user interface [Toolblox DApp builder](/docs/dapp_builder/intro) allows to fully customize the user journey
and how the information is entered.

A DApp is a 'decenteralized application': while it might look like a normal web site, all inputs, validation and payments are handled by a smart contract deployed to a blockchain. 
In the case of Toolblox, the underlying data storage and functionality are delegated to workflows. 

Here you can see an example DApp which uses the above example workflow as its underlying set of rules and storage:
