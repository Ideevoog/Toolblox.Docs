# What is Toolblox?

Toolblox is a no-code smart contract builder, specifically designed to manage lifecycles of digital twins. Digital twins are digital representations of real-world business objects such as documents, offers, parcels, loans, requests, harvests etc.

# Workflows

The [Smart contract builder](/docs/smart-contract-builder/introduction) allows to compose workflows which are then compiled into smart-contracts and deployed on a selected blockchain network.

Each workflow consist of a definition of an [item](smart-contract-builder/items), list of [item states](smart-contract-builder/states) and [state transitions](smart-contract-builder/transitions/transition_basics). The workflow is represented visually in the editor as a state diagram.

:::note

A state-diagram based workflow is something which has been found across the industry to naturally fit the blockchain programming model. Here you can see a [case-study by the Hyperledger Foundation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/it/latest/developapps/scenario.html) detailing the sale of the *item* 'commercial paper' with its *states* and state *transitions* mapped out in a format suitable for a self-executing smart contract![Image](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-docs-i18n/raw/release-2.2/docs/locale/it_IT/source/developapps/develop.diagram.4.png)

The same example depicted above would look like this in the Smart contract builder of Toolblox:

# DApps

The [DApp builder](/docs/dapp_builder) allows to create fully functioning and custom-themed public-facing web sites. 
DApp is a 'decenteralized application': while it might look like a normal web site, all inputs, validation and payments are handled by a smart contract deployed. 
In the case of Toolblox, the underlying data storage and functionality are delegated to workflows. 

Here you can see an example DApp which uses the above example workflow as its underlying set of rules and storage:
